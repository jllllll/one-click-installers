Thank you for downloading oobabooga/text-generation-webui.
Here is how to get it up and running:

1. Run the "webui.ps1" script in Powershell to install the web UI and its requirements in this folder (~/text-gen-install for WSL).
2. When the installation is complete, you will see a menu.

To add flags like --chat, --notebook, --extensions, etc, edit the
"CMD_FLAGS.txt" file using a text editor and add the desired flags.

To get the latest updates in the future, just re-run the "webui.ps1" script in Powershell and select the update option.
This will only install the updates, so it should be much faster.
May need to uninstall the "quant_cuda" python package if GPTQ-for-LLaMa needs to be updated.

You can open a command-line attached to the virtual environment by running the "webui.ps1" script in Powershell and selecting the appropriate option.
