Thank you for downloading oobabooga/text-generation-webui.
Here is how to get it up and running:

1. Run the "install" script to install the web UI and its requirements in this folder.
2. Run the "download-model" script to download a model of your choice.
3. Run the "start-webui" script to launch the web UI.

To add flags like --api, --cpu, --extensions, etc, edit the
"start-webui" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the CMD_FLAGS variable at the top. It should look like this:

set "CMD_FLAGS=--auto-launch"

For instance, to add the --api flag, change it to

set "CMD_FLAGS=--auto-launch --api"

To get the latest updates in the future, just re-run the "install" script.
This will only install the updates, so it should be much faster.

You can open a command-line attached to the virtual environment by running the "conda-cmd" script.

This installer uses a custom-built Windows-compatible version of bitsandbytes. Source: https://github.com/acpopescu/bitsandbytes/tree/cmake_windows
